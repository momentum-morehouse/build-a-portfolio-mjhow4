        Hi, I am Marlon Howard. You can call me the coding lawyer or the lawyer coder. I am a Howard Alum, a NC Central Law School and Georgetown Law School Graduate. I love coding because I love being challenged and I love creating. It may be hard to believe but coding and law aren't that different. They both are based on words or language. In law, the right words will win your case. In coding, the right words can create something awesome. Further, in law there is a maxim that says the drafter of the contract is the master of the universe. In that contract you can change the meaning of words; give old words new meanings, create new words, in fact, you can create an entirely new language. As long as the other parties to your contract know what you mean and agree to it, it can be a valid contract. In coding, the coder is the master of the universe they are creating.</p1>
